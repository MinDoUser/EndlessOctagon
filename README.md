# Endless Octagon
A java mod. <br> *[more soon]*
<br><br>
Please note that:<br>
<code><i>This mod is <b>far away</b> from <b>done</b>! </i><br>
There are a lot of things maybe not work or still missing!</code>
<br>
<br>
<code>I still have to understand the methods and classes of Mindustry and the Arc Libary, therefor some visual effects and other stuff <b>may not work!</b></code>

## The Idea
<br>
The idea is to add a new Campaign planet with a own set of blocks, items, etc.
This planet is <del>(so far)</del> called Eravir and also nowhere near done.

This mod also add some intresting features and override some ingame dialogs...
