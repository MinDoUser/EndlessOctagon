# Endless Octagon
A java mod. <br> *[more soon]*
<br><br>
Please note that:<br>
<i>This mod is <b>far away</b> from <b>done</b>! </i><br>
There are a lot of things maybe not work or still missing!

## The Idea
<br>
The idea is to add a new Campaign planet with a own set of blocks, items, etc.

This planet is <del>(so far)</del> called **Eravir** and also nowhere near done. (Non existent yet...)

This mod also add some intresting features and override some ingame dialogs...

## The Features
<ul>
  <li> 
    A _Block Checker_ 
    <br>
    The Block Checker is a option to check whether a block can build with the items in the core.
  </li>
  <li> <i>soon</i> </li>
</ul>
